This is a simple Angular 2 app which allows you to easily add a fun quiz to any
web site. The quiz questions are easily customizable (they are stored in the
src/data/questions.json file).

To install it, first install the Node.js package manager (npm). Then, cd to the
directory that contains this README file, and run the following command:

$ npm install

This will take a few minutes, so you may want to go grab a beverage. When it's
finished, type this:

$ npm start

This will transpile the app, and then start a little web server on port 3000 of
the machine so you can play around with it. When you see "Compilation complete.
Watching for file changes." in the output, the quiz should be reachable in your
web browser by going to:

http://<your-ip-or-localhost>:3000/

Have fun! :~)
